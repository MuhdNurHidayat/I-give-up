# I GIVE UP
This repository contains directories of failed attempts to compile stuff from source, mainly attempted to compile for software that I want to use on my Debian or Ubuntu arm64 (aarch64) instance on my phone, as my laptop broke down in January 2020 and I no longer have any amd64 device where most software I'm using are available for install.

The app I use to create Debian or Ubuntu instance on my phone is [UserLAnd](https://userland.tech/), accompanied by [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) to view and interact with the desktop graphical interface of the Debian or Ubuntu instance and [Simple Protocol Player](https://kaytat.com/?page_id=301) to listen audio from those instances so long [pulseaudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) is running on them.

## Aegisub 3.2.2
The directory was downloaded from the TAR.XZ file in the releases, which could be found [here](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub/releases/tag/v3.2.2). I've tried my best to compile ARM64 version because it is not available on any Ubuntu repo, but I gave up. Last attempt results in some kind of file not in directory, where `make` is expecting the file `bitmap.cpp` but it was never in the repository. I have even check against the original source code TAR.XZ and it's not there. I'm thinking that it might be generated by some kind of magic on the original developer side that I can't replicate.

Last few lines of my attempt could be read from the included [cmds.txt](aegisub-3.2.2/cmds.txt) file in the directory.

## Aegisub 85f711f
The directory was cloned directly from the repository as at commit [85f711f](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub/tree/85f711fccc75f01fd44f25537b8777df10c4b3d1) on GitHub. At the time of cloning, there is newer commit but it haa failed checks so I'm thinking that the newer commits would fail as well. I cloned Aegisub again because I'm thinking if the stable release is too old for the libraries I'm currently using and I was very hoping to get it compiled and running. But I gave up as well. I was already too tired from trying so many commands including tweaking with my instance but it still won't work, so really, I gave up as well.

Last few lines of my attempt could be read from the included [cmds.txt](aegisub-85f711f/cmds.txt) file in the directory.
